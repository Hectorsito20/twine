twill-spynner: An implementation of twill based on spynner
===================================================

twill-spynner implements the twill scripting language using
spynner(https://github.com/makinacorpus/spynner). This will allow
for some new features, most notably JavaScript support.

This is currently in an experimental state and should not be
expected to be stable. Only a few core commands are available at
the moment.

A majority of the code is borrowed from twill itself.

From the twill README.txt:

twill is a simple scripting language intended for programmatic or
automated browsing of Web sites.

Documentation is available in the release package under
doc/index.txt or doc/index.html.

The latest release as well as all documentation is always online at
http://twill.idyll.org/.  You can also find
information on mailing lists, bug fixes, and new releases there.
