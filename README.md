# twill-spynner: An implementation of twill based on spynner

twill-spynner implements the [twill](https://github.com/ctb/twill) scripting language using
[spynner](https://github.com/makinacorpus/spynner). This will allow
for some new features, most notably JavaScript support.

Most of the core commands are implemented so far,
the main exception being form handling. However, it's
still a pretty new project so there are a fair amount
of bugs to work out.

A large portion of the code is borrowed from twill itself.
