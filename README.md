# twine

twine is an implementation of the [twill](https://github.com/ctb/twill) scripting language using
[spynner](https://github.com/makinacorpus/spynner). This will allow
for some new features, most notably JavaScript support.

Most of the core commands are implemented so far,
the main exception being form handling. However, it's
still a pretty new project so there are a fair amount
of bugs to work out.

A large portion of the code is borrowed from twill itself.
In particular, the tests and examples are directly from
twill so they might not be functional or accurate running in
twine.
